        <h1> My Favorite Hobby <br><span id="name">Basketball</span></h1>

        <p>My hobby is playing basketball. Basketball is my favorite sport. When I get some free time, I go outside to my backyard with my friends or alone and play basketball. Basketball is the game which requires physical fitness. The running between baskets, dribbling, and shooting make my body fit and mind fresh. So, after playing basketball. I also become delighted by playing basketball because I donâ€™t waste my mind sitting in front of a computer or playing video games. Instead, I do some healthy activity. Everyday, I have one or two hours of free time. Sometimes I play basketball at that time. I have purchased my basketball kit such as shoes, basketball, hoop, and jersey.
